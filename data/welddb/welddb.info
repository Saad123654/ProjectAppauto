Purpose

Provides chemical composition and mechanical property data for a collection of all weld metal deposits.


Description

The tar file contains data for the chemical composition of the steels studied, and their room temperature mechanical properties. These data have been collated from available literature. The presence of an ``N'' indicates that the value was not reported in the publication. This is NOT meant to be an indication that the value is zero. Although many columns are presented here, those which only have a small amaount of data have been removed for the analysis described in [1 and 2]. This enabled more input lines to be used for neural network analysis.
